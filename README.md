P1 Madlibs: A program that mainly uses string concatenation to combines strings with user input to produce a silly story. I significantly upgraded it 3 ways:

    #1 automated counting the number of placeholders for each word type
    #2 automated tracking the number times the CLI calls for user input
    #3 automated replacing the placeholders with user input

These 3 upgrades allow the programmer to edit the just the initial paragraph, without needing to manage the rest of the code. The one exception is if they want to add a new word type. Given that, I do believe there is still space to grow if I could somehow create one location to place all the word types and thus reproduce the appropriate functions for each of the 3 upgraded features. Similar to how terraform uses one variable file called by countless different modules. The upgrades seem repetitive, code wise, so that is why I am wondering if there is a better way.
